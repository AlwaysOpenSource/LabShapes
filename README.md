# Lab Shapes  

### Recipe for the cookies:  
1	cup butter (Cubed, cold)  
1	cup granulated white sugar  
2	eggs  
4	cups all-purpose flour  
3/4	cup cornstarch  
3/4	tsp salt  
1	tsp vanilla extract  

#### Baking Instructions
1) Preheat the oven to 350 or 375 (less burning small edges on 350)  
2) Cream butter and sugar  
3) Mix eggs into butter/sugar mixture until incorperated  
4) Mix in cornstarch and salt  
5) Mix in flour 1/2 cup at a time until dough gathers into a ball and pulls cleanly away from the sides of the bowl.  
	It may seem very dry/sandy, but it should come together within ~3-5 min.  
6) Roll the dough out between 2 sheets of parchment paper or saran wrap.  
	Dough should be 1/4 inch thick.  
7) Prepare a baking sheet with parchment paper  
8) Cut dough into shapes and transfer to baking sheet  
9) Place baking sheet in freezer for 5-10 min  
9*) (OPTIONAL) Crack an egg in a seperate bowl and homogenize it. Using a brush, lightly brush on egg so the raised portions are coated but the indents remain untouched.  
		You can also add color to the egg wash by using food coloring.  
10) Bake for 9-13 minutes or until edges turn light brown.  


#### Note:  
To get an even thickness use rolling pin spacers or buy 1/4 inch dowels at your local hardware store. Home Depot has them near the Moulding section.
